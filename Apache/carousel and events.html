                            NOESIS is the signature event of Vision. It was started in year 2011 and still continues to be the biggest technical event of the institute after Technosearch, the annual technical festival of the college. It is a two day mega technical event conducted in mid September every year. In the past few years NOESIS received a great response. In year 2k16, it was conducted on 17th and 18th September. Students from various colleges enthusiastically participated in great number. There were more than 1000 participations. During NOESIS usually branch specific technical workshops are organised so as to acquaint students with the recent advancements in their branches giving them an edge over with hands on projects.

                            Vision had a flourishing adventure in the previous sessions organizing workshops with a wide range of topics starting from a basic WLT session to a whole new  level of an Inter-college  Arduino  workshop , involving students from all over Bhopal. Vision helped various participants to build their own bots, modify them and prepared to a level for competing at National Level techfest. Vision also provided insight in coding world through iniatiative such as Exploring C and Web Development using HTML &amp; CSS.

                                        C Workshops are organized annually at the beginning of the session by the Computer Science team of VISION to guide the newcomers in the field of computer science. It’s a three day ride where the team begins teaching the language from the most basic level .Students from every branch attended the workshop in order to get well acquainted with the basics of the language and move ahead in the world  of programming. Students attended the workshop with great enthusiasm. VISION also received a huge response from students outside MANIT.

Furthermore we had another session covering  theory and hands on of a “Wireless Remote Controlled” robot which introduced everyone with the concept of wireless communication. We had a huge participation of around 400 students .
